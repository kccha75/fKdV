# fKdV
Steady Forced KdV equation with sech^2 forcing

Uses pseudo arc-length continuation with parameters gamma and Delta to generate hydraulic fall continuation. See Ee and Clarke (2007)

Line Search uses pseudo arc-length continuation with parameter gamma for Delta = 0. Generates Keeler et al (2017) solutions originating from Solitary waves

Not the cleanest code ... may get back to it someday to clean it up
